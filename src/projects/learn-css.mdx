CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to describe the visual appearance 
and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). It allows web developers 
to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other aspects of the presentation of a web page.
CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styling rules to them. These rules define 
how the elements should be displayed on the page. CSS rules consist of a selector, which identifies 
the HTML elements to target, and a declaration block, which contains the styling properties and their 
values.
